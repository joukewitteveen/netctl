NETCTL(1)
=========

NAME
----
netctl - Control the netctl network profile manager


SYNOPSIS
--------
*netctl* {*COMMAND*} [+PROFILE+]

*netctl* [--help | --version]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*netctl* may be used to introspect and control the state of the systemd
services for the network profile manager.


OPTIONS
-------
The following commands are understood:

*list*::
    List all available profiles. Online profiles will be marked with a
    `&ast;', otherwise active profiles will be marked with a `&plus;'.

*store*::
    Saves which profiles are currently active.

*restore*::
    Loads the profiles that were active during the last invocation of
    `*store*'.

*stop-all*::
    Stops all active network profiles.

*start [+PROFILE+]*::
    Start the network profile specified on the command line.

*stop [+PROFILE+]*::
    Stop the network profile specified on the command line.

*restart [+PROFILE+]*::
    Restart the network profile specified on the command line. If it is
    not started yet, it will be started.

*switch-to [+PROFILE+]*::
    Starts the network profile specified on the command line after
    stopping all profiles that refer to the same interface.

*is-active [+PROFILE+]*::
    Check whether the network profile specified on the command line is
    active. Prints the current state.

*status [+PROFILE+]*::
    Show terse runtime status information about a profile, followed by
    its most recent log data from the journal.

*enable [+PROFILE+]*::
    Enable the systemd unit for the profile specified. This will create
    a unit configuration file. If the file already exists, the command
    fails. No other profiles than the one specified will be enabled.
    Changes to the general options in a profile specification will not
    propagate to the unit configuration file automatically. After such
    changes, it is necessary to `*reenable*' the profile.

*disable [+PROFILE+]*::
    Disable the systemd unit for the profile specified. This will remove
    the file created by `*enable*' even if it was customized, so be
    careful.

*reenable [+PROFILE+]*::
    Reenable the systemd unit for the profile specified. This is
    effectively a combination of `*disable*' and `*enable*'.

*is-enabled [+PROFILE+]*::
    Check whether the systemd unit for the specified profile is enabled.
    Prints the current enable status.

*edit [+PROFILE+]*::
    Open the file of the specified profile in an editor. This does not
    reenable or restart any profiles.

*wait-online [+PROFILE+]*::
    Wait until the interface of the profile has a routable IP address of
    some kind.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
On success 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.


ENVIRONMENT
-----------
'$NETCTL_DEBUG'::
    If set to +"yes"+, debugging output is generated. +
    The value of this variable is independent of the value of the
    variable with the same name in profiles.
'$NETCTL_STATE_FILE'::
    The location of the state file. Defaults to
    '/var/lib/netctl/netctl.state'.
