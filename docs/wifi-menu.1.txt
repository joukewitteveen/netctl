WIFI-MENU(1)
============

NAME
----
wifi-menu - Interactively connect to a wireless network


SYNOPSIS
--------
*wifi-menu* [-o | --obscure] [+INTERFACE+]

*wifi-menu* [-h | --help]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*wifi-menu* allows to interactively connect to a wireless network on
+INTERFACE+ using a netctl profile. In case no netctl profile is
available, one can be generated. If only one wireless interface is
available, +INTERFACE+ can be omitted.

*wifi-menu* is only able to generate netctl profiles for simple network
configurations. Profiles for more complex configurations must be set up
manually. See *netctl.profile*(5) for more information.


OPTIONS
-------
+-h+, +--help+::
    Print a short help text and exit.

+-o+, +--obscure+::
    Show asterisks for the characters of the password and store the password
    as a hexadecimal pre-shared key.

+INTERFACE+::
    The wireless network interface to use for connecting.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
+0+::
    The interface connected to the wireless network successfully.

+1+::
    The connection attempt was canceled.

+2+::
    The connection attempt failed.

+3+::
    No wireless networks were found.

+4+::
    Invalid passphrase length (+WEP+ keys must be between 8 and 63
    characters in length).

+7+::
    An unexpected error code was received.

+255+::
    The command was invalid or the connection attempt was aborted.


NOTES
-----
Establishing a connection may take a minute. While establishing a
connection, nothing is shown on screen.

Starting a connection on an interface that is controlled by
*netctl-auto* will cause *wifi-menu* to switch to the selected network.
The interface will continue to be controlled by *netctl-auto*.


ENVIRONMENT
-----------
'$NETCTL_DEBUG'::
    If set to +"yes"+, debugging output is generated.


FILES
-----
'/etc/netctl'::
    Directory where generated profiles are stored.
