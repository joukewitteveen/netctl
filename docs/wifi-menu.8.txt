wifi-menu - Interactively connect to a wireless network


SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*wifi-menu* allows a user to interactively connect to a wireless network
over INTERFACE using an existing netctl profile, or an automatically
generated profile for basic configurations. If only one wireless
interface is available, INTERFACE can be omitted.  If no interface is
specified and more than one is detected, a choice of interfaces is
offered.

configurations. Profiles for more complex configurations must be set up
manually, or through the use of other tools.
