WIFI-MENU(8)
============

NAME
----
wifi-menu - Interactively connect to a wireless network


SYNOPSIS
--------
*wifi-menu* [-o | --obscure] [+INTERFACE+]

*wifi-menu* [-h | --help]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*wifi-menu* allows a user to interactively connect to a wireless network 
over INTERFACE using a auto-generated netctl profile. If only one 
wireless interface is available, INTERFACE can be omitted. Additionally,
if INTERFACE is omitted and more than one wireless interface is found, 
the user is prompted to select which interface should be used.

Once a valid interface is specified, wifi-menu uses *wpa_supplicant*(8) 
to scan for available wireless networks, and presents the results to the 
user in a menu. Entries are marked with one of the following flags to 
indicate their status:

***::
    An active connect is present.

*:*::
    A hand-made profile is present.

*.*::
    An automatically-generated profile is present.

If a network is selected that already has a profile, the profile is 
immediately started with no further interaction. However, if the selected 
network lacks a profile, the user is given the option of accepting or
changing the provided profile name. Next, if the selected network is 
encrypted, the user is prompted to enter a passphrase or pre-shared key, 
as appropriate. Once this is done, a *netctl*(1) profile is created and 
then started. If the connection is successful, the program exits; if 
unsuccessful, the user is asked whether the profile should still be saved.

OPTIONS
-------

*-h, --help*::
    Print a short help text and exit.

*-o, --obscure*::
    Show asterisks for the characters of the password and store the password
    as a hexadecimal string.

+INTERFACE+::
    The wireless network interface to use for connecting.


EXIT STATUS
-----------

*0*::
    The interface connected to the wireless network successfully.

*1*::
    The connection attempt was cancelled.

*2*::
    The connection attempt failed.

*3*::
    No wireless networks were found.

*4*::
    Invalid passphrase length (WEP keys must be between 8 and 63 characters
    in length).

*7*::
    An unexpected error code was received.

*255*::
    The connection attempt was aborted (or an error occurred).


NOTES
-----
Establishing a connection may take a minute. While establishing a connection,
nothing is shown on screen.


BUGS
----
This program is not capable of setting up and establishing connections that 
require configurations more complex than the specification of a passphrase.
In such situations, one should manually configure and establish the 
connection using a network manager such as *netctl*(1), or use lower-level 
utilities such as *wpa_supplicant*(8) directly, along with  *ip*(8) or 
*dhcpcd*(8) for configuring IP connectivity.


ENVIRONMENT
-----------
+$NETCTL_DEBUG+::
    If set to +"yes"+, debugging output is generated.


FILES
-----
+/etc/netctl+::
    Directory where generated profiles are stored.
