NETCTL.SPECIAL(7)
=================

NAME
----
netctl.special - Special netctl systemd units


SYNOPSIS
--------
netctl.service, netctl-auto.service, netctl-ifplugd.service,
netctl-wait-online.service


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Bundled with netctl come a few systemd units that are not controlled
through the netctl command. They can be used through the systemctl
utility of systemd.


SPECIAL UNITS
-------------
netctl.service::
    When started, this unit tries to start the profiles that were
    running when the unit was last stopped. In some cases, the interface
    a profile binds to might not be available yet, when 'netctl.service'
    tries to bring a profile up. A simple, hackish, solution is to do:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
echo "[[ -t 0 ]] || sleep 3" > /etc/netctl/interfaces/<interface>
chmod 755 /etc/netctl/interfaces/<interface>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
    A more concise solution is to first enable a profile through netctl
    and then disable it again through systemctl:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
netctl enable <profile>
systemctl disable netctl@<profile>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
    This way the unit configuration file for the profile remains in
    existence, while the profile is not enabled.

netctl-sleep.service::
    When enabled, this unit stores and stops the active network profiles
    before the machine is put to sleep. After the system is resumed,
    previously stored profiles are restarted.

netctl-auto@<interface>.service::
    This unit issues a scan on the interface it is used for and tries to
    start a profile for a network it finds. It is targeted at wireless
    interfaces. Profile specific values for 'WPADriver' are ignored, but
    it is possible to specify 'WPADriver=' in an interface hook
    ('/etc/netctl/interfaces/<interface>'). +
    Use *netctl-auto*(1) instead of *netctl(1)* to control the automatic
    profile selection when using this unit.

netctl-ifplugd@<interface>.service::
    This unit starts ifplugd on the interface it is used for. It will
    try to start a netctl profile whenever a cable is plugged into the
    interface and stop the profile when the cable is unplugged. Note
    that this unit does not provide 'network.target'.

netctl-wait-online.service::
    When activated, this unit waits for all enabled netctl profiles to
    come online. Enabling this unit causes 'network-online.target' to
    only be reached once all enabled netctl profiles are fully
    connected. The maximum time, in seconds, to wait for profiles can be
    passed to this unit via 'TIMEOUT_ONLINE='. The default value is
    +120+. If a timeout occurs, the service enters a failed state.
